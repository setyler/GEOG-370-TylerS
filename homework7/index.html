    <h1>North Carolina Deer Harvest By County: Number of Antlered Bucks Harvested per Square Mile</h1>
    <text>GEOG 370-006 // Homework 7 // Suzanne Tyler // March 3, 2022</text>

    <h3>Map</h3>
    <text>This map was made using data on deer harvest during the 2020-21 hunting season from the NC Wildlife Resources Commission. I chose to represent this data because I was interested in seeing how the popularity of deer hunting varies accross the state. In my county (Stokes), the popularity is high as I expected. County vector data was taken from the census webstie. I used equal count data categorization because after trying out a few different types I felt that it best represented the data.</text>
