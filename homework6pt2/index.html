<h2>Map 1</h2>
<text>This map was made using equal count data categorization. This means that the input values were equally distributed between each output color on the map. The nice thing about this kind of data categorization is that the map shows an even color distribution. However, this could mean that data is misrepresented. A high number of a specific value would be hard to see on this map becuase the categories each have an equal number of values.</text>

<h2>Map 2</h2>
<text>This map was made using equal interval categorization. Equal interval categorization is used for looking at the distribution of values accross the interval. It's easy to see based on the prevalence of one color on the map how common a specific range of data is. The downside of this is that if the data is extremely concentrated, the map might be completely dominated by one color and not provide much useful information at all. In this map it's easy to see that values between 29 and 41 are much more common than values under 29.</text>

<h2>Map 3</h2>
<text>For the final map I chose to use pretty breaks to categorize the data. The biggest reason for using pretty breaks is because they are, quite literally, nice to look at. The categories are split at convenient numbers, in this case every 10 percent. The main drawback of pretty breaks is that the data often doesn't work out in such a way that the map is helpful or useful. For this map specifically, pretty breaks come at too close intervals. This means there are too many colors involved and it's hard to tell exactly waht color each county is. It is often better to chose a categorization based on what best represents the data in a way that is easy to pick up on when looking at the map. Using pretty breaks for this data set resulted in a rather monochrome map, which doesn't provide much useful information.</text>
